# Data-Analysis-on-CSV-Files
Analyze sales data using Python and Pandas to gain basic data insights and visualize sales trends.

Tools Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook)

Dataset
File: sales_data.csv

Columns:
Order_ID – Unique ID for each order
Date – Order date
Category – Product category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Furniture)
Quantity – Number of units sold
Unit_Price – Price per unit (in currency units)
Revenue – Total revenue for the order

Steps Performed:
Load CSV using pandas.read_csv()
Basic exploration:
.head() to preview data
.nfo() for column details
.describe() for summary statistics
.shape for dimensions
Missing value check using .isnull().sum()

Groupby analysis:
Group by Category and calculate total Revenue

Filtering:
Select rows where Revenue > 500

Indexing:
loc[] vs iloc[] examples

Visualizations:
Bar Chart: Revenue by Category
Line Chart: Quantity sold over time


Key Concepts Covered:
Pandas DataFrame operations
CSV loading and exploration
groupby() and sum()
Data filtering
.loc[] vs .iloc[]
.head() usage
Visualization with plot()
Handling missing values

How to Run the Notebook in Colab:
Open Google Colab.
Create a new notebook.
Upload sales_data.csv when prompted by the code.
Run all cells to generate results and charts.
Download .ipynb and push it to GitHub.

Example Charts:
Bar Chart – Revenue by Category
X-axis: Category
Y-axis: Total Revenue
Shows which category earned the most revenue.
Line Chart – Quantity Sold Over Time
X-axis: Date
Y-axis: Quantity Sold per Day
Shows trends in sales volume.
